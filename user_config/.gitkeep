# This 'user_config' directory, located at the project root, is for your personal configurations.
# Files placed here (e.g., ui_config.yaml, actions_config.yaml) will override the
# default configurations found in the 'config_examples/' directory.

# To get started with customization:
# 1. Copy 'config_examples/ui_config.yaml' to this directory.
# 2. Copy 'config_examples/actions_config.yaml' to this directory.
# 3. Modify the copied files as needed.

# This directory is typically added to .gitignore if your configurations are
# machine-specific or contain sensitive information.
# If your configurations are generic and meant to be shared with the project,
# you might choose to commit them (though 'config_examples' serves as the base).

# This .gitkeep file helps in versioning this directory if it's initially empty.
